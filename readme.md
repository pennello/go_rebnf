`rebnf` is a tool to generate random productions of arbitrary EBNF
grammars.

Documentation
-------------
 - [GoDoc Documentation](https://godoc.org/chrispennello.com/go/rebnf)

Installation
------------
    go get chrispennello.com/go/rebnf/cmd/rebnf

Tools
-----
The `tools` directory contains a Python tool for fetching Unicode
character ranges from [fileformat.info][1] and consolidating them into EBNF
alternative range expressions, suitable for consumption by `rebnf`.

Test Languages
--------------
The `testlang` directory contains grammars for testing and
experimentation.  In particular, `testlang/go` contains a snapshot of
the Go Programming Language Specification and an extracted grammar,
including one in which the Unicode productions have been defined.

Future Work
-----------
 - More reliable termination soon after recursion depth limit exceeded.
   More reliable terminal path analysis.  Graph analysis of grammar
   productions.
 - Non-uniform production weighting.
 - Mode to prefer non-weird characters (e.g., put it in "ASCII mode").
